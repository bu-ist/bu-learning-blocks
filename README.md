BU Learning Blocks (BULB) is a collection of Gutenberg blocks and WordPress Custom Post Types that enable the easy creation of academic lessons. With BULB you can facilitate online learning by embedding self-assessment questions directly into your lesson. Creating and publishing a BULB Lesson is no different than creating a standard WordPress Page. The plugin provides two key capabilities that are not provided by WordPress:

- A set of blocks that help you add different types of self-assessment questions
- A way to order and navigate multiple Lesson Pages in a specific sequence

BULB is not a Learning Management System (LMS) and, currently, does not have typical LMS features such as scoring or timers. The objective of BULB is to improve learning and retention through in-line questions that reinforce the subject matter and allow students to test their understanding directly within the Lesson Page.

BULB questions are inserted into the lesson content through the placement of blocks into the page editor. The questions are added and articulated in the WordPress block editor and are saved within the Lesson Page content. BULB does not add any tables to the WordPress database.

BULB is compatible with WordPress 5.3.2 and above and the Gutenberg editor must be enabled.
